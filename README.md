### Prep Time: 5 minutes
### Cook Time: 12-15 minutes

### Step 1
## Dry Ingridents
| Amount  | Name  | 
|---|---|
|2.5 cups| Almond Flour|
|1.5 tsp| Baking soda|
* Hand Mix

### Step 2
## Heated Ingridents

| Amount  | Name  | 
|---|---|
|6 tbsp| Sugar Free Strawberry Preserves
|2 tsp| Vanilla Extract |
|10 tbsp | Grass Fed Butter [melted]
* Combine and melt

### Step 3
## Eggs
| Amount  | Name  | 
|---|---|
|3 Large | Egg Whites |
|2 Large | Whole Eggs |
* Mix eggs into dry (Step 1)

### Step 4
You should now have the dry ingredients and eggs mixed together (step 1 and 3). Finally mix the heated intgredients (step 2) and mix until a batter forms.

#### Cook

Usually 12-15 minutes @ 350 degrees. When the top is golden brown you can poke with a toothpick to test.

Use whatever pan you like and adjust the time as needed. i.e. - a donut pan is great but cooks faster.
