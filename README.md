My recipe for low carb, high fat bread. Nutritional Info here -> http://www.myfitnesspal.com/recipe/view/203855815987197

### Prep Time: 5 minutes
### Cook Time: 12-15 minutes

### Step 1
## Dry Ingridents
| Amount  | Name  | 
|---|---|
|2 cups| Almond Flour|
|1 tsp| Baking soda|
|2 tbsp | xylitol (optional but will make it taste almost exactly like a chocolate cake that uses sugar)
|5 tbsp | cocoa powder (optional for chocolate muffins)
* Hand Mix

### Step 2
## Heated Ingridents

| Amount  | Name  | 
|---|---|
|4 tbsp| Sugar Free Strawberry Preserves
|2 tsp| Vanilla Extract |
|10 tbsp | Grass Fed Butter [melted]
* Combine and melt

### Step 3
## Eggs
| Amount  | Name  | 
|---|---|
|3 Large | Egg Whites |
|1 Large | Whole Eggs |
* Mix eggs into dry (Step 1)

### Step 4
You should now have the dry ingredients and eggs mixed together (step 1 and 3). Finally mix the heated intgredients (step 2) and mix until a batter forms. Make sure it's frothy.

#### Cook

Usually 12-15 minutes @ 350 degrees. When the top is golden brown you can poke with a toothpick to test.

Use whatever pan you like and adjust the time as needed. i.e. - a donut pan is great but cooks faster.


#### Frosting Ideas
Cream Cheese + Sugar Free Strawberry Preserves: Combine in small ball and mix until frothy.
