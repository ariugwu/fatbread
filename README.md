### Prep Time: 5 minutes
### Cook Time: 12-15 minutes

## Dry Ingridents
* Hand Mix
| Amount  | Name  | 
|---|---|
|2.5 cups| Almond Flour|
|1.5 tsp| Baking soda|

## Wet Ingridents
* Combine and melt
| Amount  | Name  | 
|---|---|
|6 tbsp| Sugar Free Strawberry Preserves
|2 tsp| Vanilla Extract |
|10 tbsp | Grass Fed Butter [melted]


* Combine Dry and Wet until batter

## Cook

Usually 12-15 minutes @ 350 degrees. When the top is golden brown you can poke with a toothpick to test.

Use whatever pan you like and adjust the time as needed. i.e. - a donut pan is great but cooks faster.
